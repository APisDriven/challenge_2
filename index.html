        <h2>Just a big-town boy, living here in West Detroit!</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in Detoit in the 90's and 2000's. It was a great time to
            be young. The internet was newly established and society
            was entering the information age. I took an interest in technology
            early, and read my first HTML book when I was eight years old.
            Twenty-(something) years later, I'm formally learning how to code.  You
            may be wondering, "what took you so long?" And to that, I would reply, "all good things take
            time, my friend." Check out my work, follow me on social media, and
            let me know what you think of my art!
